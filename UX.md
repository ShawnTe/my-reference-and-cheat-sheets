### Profile user
ex. My mom
teacher all her life (offline)
loves doing things with family
loves to travel
researches online, users 2 fingers
gets to Travelocity and... ugh!

### Bad design
No clear call to action
Cluttered
No visual hierarchy
Poor use of gradients. Usually for buttons, not for shading areas.
Do not save text as image

### "Ultimate User Experience"
Gestalt principles -- visual perception theories from the 1920's
*proximity* - where items are placed in relationship to each other. Ex. a headline should behave like a headline. Group related content so that user knows exactly what to do.  Labels to forms: left align, right align, above align. Above align is way faster for user to read. Also, bold is slower to read.



continuity -- easiest path for user.
similarity -- user repeating elements and people will know what to do faster
figure/ground -- use contrast to separate items, for ex. thumbnails on netflix, alternate dark and light. Also, same size images.
closure

### Other
Can have fun with the button, for ex. remind user what they are doing there ("Find me a great deal!")
Accessibility (to be read), for ex. 80 char/line max.
Visual assurance of where user is/what they're supposed to do. Hover and link assurance appears.
