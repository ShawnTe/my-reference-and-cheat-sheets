gem open ___ activerecord  ('open' not working on my pea brain)

## Naming Conventions
- Class names are singular CamelCase
- Table names are plural snake_case
- Foreign key is snake_case_id

## Setting up table
    Class CreateCats < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def change
        create_table :cats do |t|
          t.integer :age, presence: true   (a validation)
          t.string :name, null: false
          t.text :description
          t.references :breeds
          t.boolean :neutered

          t.timestamps null: false  (auto creates created and updated columns)
        end
          add_index :breeds, :breed_type_id   (often index foreign ID -- on one side of relationship)

      end 
    end

## Instance methods
- #where(name: "Jayda")
- #where("dog_id = 1 AND cuteness < 10")
- #where("dog_id = ? AND name LIKE ?", 1, '%Te%')
- #count   (there's additional argument syntax, like {}, I think)
- #order(dog: :asc)     => (table, {})
- #limit(3)
- #pluck(:name, :age)   => attributes
- #first(2)           => args optional
- #find(1)            => index #
- #find [1,3]  or .find(1,3)
- #find_by(name: "Jayda").age      => returns age
- #find_by(age: 4)          => returns FIRST with age: 4  -- if none, returns nil
- #find_or_initialize_by(name: "Jayda")
- #find_or_create_by(name: "Jayda")
- #save
- #update_attributes(age: 3, breed: "Setter")
- #assign_attributes
- #persisted?  => i.e. saved to db
- dog[:name] = "Fido"  => reassign (w/o save) attribute

## Class level declarations/macros
- #methods
- #methods.sort
- #add_column :table, :header, :type (of data, i.e. string, integer)
- #remove_column :table, :header, ___ optional
- #rename_column :table, :old-header, :new-header
- #create [{name: "Jayda", age: 3}, {name: "Spot", age: 4}] => #new + #save & returns dog with id or nil if fail
- #new
- #save => returns true/false
- #column_names => same as just Dog

- #belongs_to :dog  (note: singular)   (same as #references)   (table belongs to table in foreign key)
- and makes available: #build_dog (doesn't persist), #create_dog (persists), and #create_dog!  (rating.create_dog)
- expects to 1. find class Dog, and 2. a dog_id in Ratings
- It's the same as (these are only needed if above expectations not met):
    class Rating
      belongs_to :dog, { :class_name => "Dog", :foreign_key => :dog_id }
      belongs_to :owner, class_name: "Person"
    end

- #has_many 
    Class Dog < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :ratings   (note plural)
      has_many :doctors, through :appointments  => not directly connected to doctors
    end
    - ratings.<<   (shovels ratings into dog's collection of ratings (?) dog.ratings yes?)
    - getter and setter methods for: #rating_ids  and  #ratings
    - methods: #build, #create #create!
    - tenley.ratings << new_rating     //  tenley.ratings.include? new_rating
    - tenley.ratings.build(coolness: 8, cuteness: 7, judge_id: 3)  (note: save on dog => tenley.save)
    - tenley.ratings = []    (an array)
    - tenley.rating_ids= rating_ids    (an array of rating_ids)

## Bundle Exec Rake _Commands_
be db: create / drop (the database) / migrate / rollback (last migration) / seed / version
be generate: model / migrations / spec

### Flow
gem install bundler (should be one time thing in workspace)
bundle install
be db:create
(generate:model NAME=Student)   (uppercase, singular)  (only have to do once i.e. if drop)
(generate:migration NAME=create_students)
be db:migrate
be db:seed


be spec
be console

## Examples
__Dog 1 should always receive cuteness score of 10__
    Rating.where("dog_id = 1 AND cuteness < 10").each { |rating| rating.cuteness = 10}.each {|rating| rating.save}

__Judge 2 rated Dog 2 but the cutemenss and coolness scores were reversed__
    Rating.where("judge_id = 2 and dog_id = 2").each { |rating| rating.update_attributes(coolness: 8, cuteness: 10) }

### Passwords
  - has_secure_password  (api_rubyonrails.org)
    looks for t.string :password_digest 

    Pull people and dogs from the database 
    Create new people
    Craet new ratings 
    Explore the getter and setter methods generated by their has many associations. 
    Reassign an owner's dogs 
    Reassign a judge's ratings. 
    Reassign with collections and with ids. 
    Build or create new dogs for owners. 
    Look at the SQL generated when we run these methods; is it what we expect?
